  excerpt: "Chernobyl and vertical governance"

There are only two episodes out of HBO's mini-series _Chernobyl_ and I'm obsessed with it. I've been evangelizing it to everyone I can. I'm not a fan of horror or disaster show. But the way this show makes me feel when I watch it and 24 hours after is combination of horror, uneasiness, disgust, and admiration. But it effectively transmit the radiation to me, like I was in the city and I'm affected by the decisions made. It's maybe the invisibility of radiation that does the trick. In any case, the production is flawless and from I can gather, it tries to be close to the reality.

We can imagine how extreme were the circumstances in Pripyat in 1986. After all, just the mention of Chernobyl gives a negative connotation of what can go wrong. A shallow thought can make us think of incompetence, the USSR, and nuclear power as a recipe for disaster. But, as always, it's a lot more complex than that.
