I was born in Lima, Peru, but I've been living in Austin, Texas, since 2015.

Hobbies

I've played basketball for many years from high school to the Lima League, for 19 years, interruptedly.

I love music in a addictive way. I suck the life the life of the albums I love, so I had to stop for some periods and start reading more. In 2018 I got my first guitar which unexpectedly became a way to clear up my mind. It's so fun to enjoy playing my favorite tunes. Current level: bold beginner.
