I was born in Lima, Peru, but I've been living in Austin, Texas, since 2015.

Hobbies

I've played basketball for many years from high school to the Lima League, for 19 years, interruptedly. I always thought I was a natural shooting guard, but can play any position if my team needs me to. Organized basketball > Pick up basketball. Current level: old school game.

I love music in a addictive way. I suck the life of the albums I love, so I had to stop for some periods and start reading more. In 2018 I got my first guitar (a modest but solid Squier Stratocaster Pro-Tone ~97) which unexpectedly became the best way to clear up my mind. It's so fun to play my favorite tunes or start improvising. Current level: bold beginner.

Growing living beings. Current beings I'm responsible for: wild yeast, basil, cattle.
