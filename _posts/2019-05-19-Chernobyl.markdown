  excerpt: "Chernobyl and vertical governance"
---
There are only two episodes out of HBO's mini-series _Chernobyl_ and I'm obsessed with it. I've been evangelizing it to everyone I can. I'm not a fan of horror or disaster show. But the way this show makes me feel when I watch it and 24 hours after is combination of horror, uneasiness, disgust, and admiration. But it effectively transmit the radiation to me, like I was in the city and I'm affected by the decisions made. It's maybe the invisibility of radiation that does the trick. In any case, the production is flawless and from I can gather, it tries to be close to reality. But without a better source, I want to use that recreation to exemplify this form of trust.

We can imagine how extreme were the circumstances in Pripyat in 1986. After all, just the mention of Chernobyl gives a negative connotation of what can go wrong. A shallow thought can make us think of incompetence, the USSR, and nuclear power as a recipe for disaster. But, as always, it's a lot more complex than that. From the Communist Party perspective, it is important it can be seen as a way to avoid a chaotic situation. But maybe more important, we can see the USSR situation with economical and political problems, during a long Cold War. Its position was very debilitated compared previous decades, but was still very strong. It was important to maintain order. Decision are made by committee and strong politicians can influence it. Any deviation is punished by not continuing in the promotion ladder, or worse. If we add that there is only one political party, we can understand all the power in USSR was concentrated in a few people. Not really a dictatorship, but absolutely close to it.

We know that

Chernobyl is not a story about technology incompetence. We know that

And it’s here where I find this style of managements fascinating. If you comply, if you go with the party decisions, if you put a positive spin and applaud the good efforts, you’ll be promoted. Ignoring issues can be overviewed.

Bringing bad news is bad, not only for you, but for all the chain of command, higher and lower. And it’s especially bad, because of what’s at stake is your future, your life, your family’s life. As long as it doesn’t show the incompetence of the Party, which is what’s most important to keep, it all can be fixed or hidden.

But Chernobyl showed a dichotomy that the Soviet Union couldn’t hide: the explosion was too big, the failure was of its own making, and hiding more information would make them see more incompetent. Two clear examples of this: not sharing information with other countries that would be affected if it’s not fixed; not sharing information with its own citizens that could’ve prevented needless deaths. All in order to safe face and preserve the party. And of course they would. It’s hard enough to say I made a mistake. I gave the wrong radiation level, I overwrote the safety protocol, I communicated an incorrect measure to the committee, I assumed we were safe without being sure, just to get along with the committee. It is very hard to admit a mistake. It is harder when I condemned other people to die because of it. But it is excruciating if admitting it would mean a possible death sentence. Or in the simplest decision table:

| | Hide | Admit |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Not caught  | Nothing | Prison |
| Got caught | Death | Death |

If these were the choices, hiding is the dominant strategy. Why would anyone admit guilt? So, who do you really trust to tell the truth under these circumstances?



Would it be better in the west?
