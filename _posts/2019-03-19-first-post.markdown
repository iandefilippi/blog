Writing is a long overdue task that I that I was planning to do a long time. My excuses are abundant, so I'm not going there. So this is just going to be a structured stream of consciousness that might or might not take shape later. The tags should help. One can only know if a player is good if you sub the player in.

I would consider this a win if someone finds this interesting or helpful.

Welcome!
